# Predicting_Winning_Teams
This is a fun code that applys machine learning concepts in sports, in particular in football games (or soccer to my American readers ). 


## Overview
We're going to predict whether or not the home team will win given a set of other statistics. The dataset for this was retrieved from [this](http://football-data.co.uk/data.php) site. 
Go to the code and you'll find a step by step help.

## Dependencies

* scikit-learn 
* xgboost
* pandas

Install missing dependencies with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). 

## Usage

Run `jupyter notebook` in terminal, then the code will pop up in your browser.
